- 👋 Hi, I’m @hdilling.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer game technology, network automation, and web technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing code katas in Python and Go, and I'm tempted starting with Rust.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate on anything right now.
- 📫 You can reach me by mail, preferably.
